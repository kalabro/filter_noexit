Node Titles Text Filter is Drupal 7 module built as an experiment after [Drupal Drinkup Moscow][1] to check module building estimations.

This module provides new Input Filter to process markdown-style markup

1. `[Optional link content](Note Title)` → `<a href="/node/1">Optional link content</a>`
2. `[Node Title]` → `<a href="/node/1">Node Title</a>`

Initial version is created by [@kalabro][2] for [no-exit.org][3] project.
